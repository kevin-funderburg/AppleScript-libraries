AppleScript Libraries
==============================================

Script libraries I've developed over the years others may find useful as well.


Kevin's Library
-----------------
- Collection of handlers useful for everyday scripting, includes text manipulation, file handling, Safari control, list manipulation and others. Shout out to Mark Aldritt (https://github.com/alldritt) for many of his great handlers in here.

Alfred Library
---------------
- Handlers for creating new Workflow script objects (mimics classes and constructors from OOP) to be used for developing Alfred 3 workflows. Shout out to Ursan Razvan for developing the original version for use with Alfred 2, I made some adjustments for Alfred 3 and added some extra useful handlers.
